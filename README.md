# Hecker
 Hecker is a feature-rich firmware for the ESP32 WROOM, inspired by the "Hecker" cat meme. It offers WiFi tools (deauthentication, scanning, MAC spoofing, beacon spam, evil portal, evil twin), network device tricks (printing "Hecker," Rickrolling TVs, camera discovery), and BLE functions (scanning, advertising, injection).
